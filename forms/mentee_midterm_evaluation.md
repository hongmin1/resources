**Project:**
MLModelScope on Z

**Project Description:**
MLModelScope (https://mlmodelscope.org/) is a playground that allows people to try ML tasks with various model types, frameworks, and hardware backends. It is jointly developed by IBM and the University of Illinois. It is currently one of the platforms that collaborate with MLPerf for ML benchmark workload validation. (IBM participates in MLPerf as a founding member, including the contribution from Z). MLModelScope enables multiple backends for model training, execution, and performance study. Currently, IBM Z is enabled. Our main goal is to validate the support of zLinux as a backend for MLModelScope.
